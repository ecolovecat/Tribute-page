            <h2 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Ho Chi Minh:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1890 - </b>On May 19, HO Chi Minh was born the second son to a family of farmers living in
                    Kim Lien, a small village in Annam (Central Vietnam). He was born NGUYEN Sinh
                    Cung but later adopted the name Ho Chi Minh (“He who enlightens”). </li>
                <li><b>1907 - </b>After receiving a primary education at a local school, Ho and his brother traveled to
                    the city of Hué to attend a prestigious Franco-Vietnamese academy. Three years
                    later, Ho left the academy before graduating and worked briefly as a schoolteacher in
                    the town of Phan Thiet</li>
                <li><b>1911 - </b>Ho traveled to Saigon and obtained a job as a cook aboard a French steam ship bound
                    for the French city of Marseille. Although the details of his journey are not well
                    documented, Ho spent the next two years traveling around the world, visiting cities in
                    Europe, Asia, North America, and, according to some accounts, Africa and South
                    America as well. Ho eventually settled in London. </li>
                <li><b>1917 - </b>Ho moved to Paris during the height of World War I. He adopted the name
                    NGUYEN Ai Quoc (“Nguyen the Patriot”) and became involved in leftist and anticolonial activism.
                </li>
                <li><b>1919 - </b>Ho worked to found the Association for Annamite Patriots, an organization composed
                    of Vietnamese nationals living in France who opposed the French colonial occupation
                    of Vietnam. He authored a petition demanding the end of the French colonial
                    exploitation of Vietnam, which he attempted to present to the world powers at the
                    Versailles Peace Conference held in the aftermath of World War I. His petition was
                    never officially recognized, but his effort was well known in Vietnam. </li>
                <li><b>1920 - </b>Ho became a founding member of the newly created French Communist Party. </li>
                <li><b>1922 - </b>Ho founded the journal Le Paria (The Pariah), which served as a venue for anticolonial
                    activists to express and disseminate their views about the French colonial
                    regime. </li>
                <li><b>1923 - </b>Ho traveled to Russia for the first time. After subsequent visits, he became
                    acquainted with the most influential Soviet leaders including Nikolai BUKHARIN,
                    Leon TROTSKY, and Joseph STALIN. While in Russia, Ho was trained as an agent
                    of the Comintern*. He studied the thought of Marx and Lenin as well as
                    organizational and revolutionary techniques. </li>
                <li><b>1925 - </b>Ho traveled to China where he worked closely with Mikhail BORODIN, a fellow
                    Comintern agent, to foment socialist revolution in China. While in China, Ho formed
                    the Thanh Nien Cach Menh Dong Chi Hoi (“Revolutionary Youth League”), later
                    known simply as Thanh Nien (“Youth”), an organization composed of Vietnamese
                    exiles living in China and dedicated to revolution in Vietnam. As the Than Nien
                    steadily grew in size, the organization began to establish connections with other
                    Vietnamese nationalist and revolutionary groups residing in Vietnam. Thanh Nien
                    also published the revolutionary journal Thanh Nien, which was secretly distributed
                    throughout Southeast Asia.</li>
                <li><b>1927 - </b>Ho was forced to leave China after CHIANG Kai-shek, the leader of the Nationalist
                    Party (Guomindang), instituted a vicious crackdown on left-wing radicals,
                    imprisoning and executing hundreds of communists and labor activists. Ho fled to
                    the Soviet Union. He spent the next few years based in Russia, but made frequent
                    trips to China to recruit members for Thanh Nien. </li>
                <li><b>1930 - </b>In Hong Kong, Ho founded the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP), later renamed
                    the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP). </li>
                <li><b>1931 - </b>Ho was arrested in Hong Kong by British authorities for his involvement in
                    revolutionary activities and was imprisoned for two years. After he was released, Ho
                    returned to Moscow where he would remain until 1938. </li>
                <li><b>1938 - </b>Ho traveled to China to serve as a military advisor for the Chinese Communist Party
                    after the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. The Chinese Communist Party and the
                    Guomindang, previously entangled in civil war, had agreed to an armistice until the
                    Japanese were defeated.</li>
                <li><b>1941 - </b>Ho returned to Vietnam for the first time since he left the country in 1911. There, he
                    founded the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh (“League for the Independence of
                    Vietnam”), later known as simply the Viet Minh, an organization composed of
                    Vietnamese nationalist and communist groups committed to Vietnamese
                    independence. Throughout the Japanese occupation of Vietnam, the Viet Minh
                    fought against both French colonial authorities and the Japanese forces occupying
                    Vietnam. </li>
                <li><b>1942 - </b>Ho was arrested by Nationalist Party (Guomindang) authorities in China and briefly
                    imprisoned. Ho began to use the pseudonym Ho Chi Minh (“He who enlightens”) by
                    which he is now remembered. </li>
                <li><b>1945 - </b>At the close of World War II, Ho Chi Minh organized the Viet Minh to foment a
                    large-scale uprising in Vietnam. The Viet Minh captured major cities across Vietnam
                    and declared Vietnam an independent state. Vietnam became known as the
                    Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh became its first president.
                    In July and August, the Allied Powers met in Berlin for the Potsdam Conference and
                    agreed to partition Vietnam into a Northern and a Southern region. In the aftermath
                    of the war, the administration of Northern Vietnam was temporarily given to
                    Nationalist China while the administration of Southern Vietnam was temporarily
                    given to the British. The British allowed French troops to reenter South Vietnam in
                    the belief that retention of the profitable colony was essential to the recovery of the
                    postwar French economy. </li>
                <li><b>1946 - </b>Ho Chi Minh signed an agreement with the French that Vietnam be recognized as an
                    Independent state, under the condition that it become of a member the French Union
                    and permit a small French military presence. This agreement proved tenuous as
                    tensions rose between French colonists and Vietnamese nationalists, eventually
                    leading to full-scale war between the French and Vietnamese. </li>
                <li><b>1951 - </b>The Vietnamese Workers Party (Lao Dong), the successor to the Indochinese
                    Communist Party (ICP), was founded. </li>
                <li><b>1954</b>Vietnamese forces defeated the French at at Dien Bien Phu, marking the collapse of
                    French power in Vietnam. At the Geneva Conference, a meeting of the major powers
                    involved in the region, it was decided that Vietnam remain divided into a Northern
                    region, now under Viet Minh control, and the Southern region, under French control
                    until a new South Vietnamese government could be established. With U.S. support,
                    NGO Dinh Diem was appointed Prime Minister of the fledgling government of South
                    Vietnam. (Note: Although Ngo is the surname, this individual is commonly referred
                    to as “Diem.”) </li>
                <li><b>1969 - </b>Ho Chi Minh died on September 2 at the age of seventy-nine. </li>
